## Phase 1: VTT overlap dedupe
### Design decisions
- Overlap check is a separate `overlap_remainder` helper, run only when `rolling_dedupe_action` returns Push (borg/src/youtube.rs, `parse_vtt_segments`). Today's prefix-growth rule is untouched and the new check runs in addition to it.
- A matching cue is pushed as a new segment carrying only the non-overlapping remainder, with its own start time; a fully covered cue is dropped. This keeps timestamps accurate for the new words.
- Overlap must be whole words and at least `MIN_OVERLAP_WORDS` (3), so a legitimately repeated short phrase is not eaten.
### Deviations
- None.
### Tradeoffs
- Fixed 3-word minimum vs. no minimum: avoids false merges at the cost of missing 1-2 word overlaps.
- `clean_vtt` (plain-text path) left unchanged vs. also fixing it: the phase names only `parse_vtt_segments`.
### Open questions
- None.
